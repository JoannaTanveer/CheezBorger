Cheezborger! Cheezborger! Cheezborger! Pepsi, no Coke! I am from Chicago and that is how we order-up our favorite beef sandwhich. In this simple application you can keep track of which burgers you have tried, and which ones are so good they can make it to your Iz Fav section. This is a full stack application made from backend to front end with a MySQL database utilizing a homegrown ORM.
